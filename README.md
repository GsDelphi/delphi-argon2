# Argon2 for Delphi

Argon2 is a password hashing function. It was selected as the winner of Google's [Password Hashing Competition](https://password-hashing.net/) in 2015.

This code is licensed under public domain **Unlicense**. One of the virtues of this license is that if you don't like the license, you can change the license to whatever you want. This means that if you are too stupid to understand what *public domain* means, you get to pick any other license:

- unlicense license
- DWTFYW license
- BSD
- GPL
- LGPL
- MIT
- Copyleft

For those of you who are *still* to dumb to understand what *public domain* means, I can official tell you:

- you're a moron
- this code is officially licensed under a hept-license (kinda like *dual* license; but seven): you can pick whichever what your corporate pea-brains understand.
